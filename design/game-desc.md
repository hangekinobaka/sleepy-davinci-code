### Components

---
- 13 White tiles
- 13 Black tiles

### Object 

---
Reveal all of your opponent's secret code before they crack yours!

### Setup

---
After removing the two `'Scramble Tiles'`, place the remaining twenty-four tiles **face down** in the center of the table and mix them thoroughly.

1. Each player takes **`four tiles`** at random, and stands them up in a wall, with the blank side facing the opponents. 

2. Place your tiles in **numerical order**, with the 
   - lowest number on your left 
   - the highest on your right
   - `W` on the right of `B` 
  
For example, if you draw W4, B7, W10 and B1, then arrage them B1, W4, B7, W10.

### Standard Play

---

1. Randomly choose one player to begin the game by drawing any one of the tiles from the center. 
2. This becomes your `'Clue Tile'` Stand it to the right side and you can see the number. **Do not** add it to your line yet.

3. You must now point to a tile in an opponent's sequence and state aloud the hidden number you think it might be. You may choose any one of your opponents.
   - If your deduction is correct, the opponent must **reveal his tile**, by tipping it forward, so that everyone an see its identity - this tile remains exposed for the rest of the game.
   
     - You may now attempt to identify another tile. You may target the same opponent or any other player.
     - If your deduction is correct and you decide to end your tum, insert the clue tile into your code without showing it to your opponents. Your secret code is now longer by one number.

   - If your deduction is incorrect, you must reveal your `'Clue Tile'` by placing it in your sequence, for all players to see. This will obviously help your opponents in cracking your code.

### Advanced Play

---
Add the `'Scramble Tiles'` into the center pile before play begins. 

If drawn, you can insert a `'Scramble Tile'` **anywhere** within you code.

### Convention

---
- If `'Clue Tiles'` run out, the game continues with players **taking turns** to state their deductions and reveal tiles until a winner emerges,

- A `'Scramble Tile'` can be placed anywhere in your sequence, this includes to the left of a zero, or the right of an eleven.

- You may not write down your guesses, you must remember them as the game develops.

### 准备

---
1. 把24 张数字牌面朝下洗混。
2. 每人抓4 张牌，黑白组合任意。
3. 把抓上来的牌按数字大小从左至右排列好，数字一样则黑的放在白的左边。
4. 任意从某个玩家开始，按顺时针方向进行游戏。

### 游戏流程：

---
1. 在你的回合中，你任意抓一张牌，放在一边，确保只有你看到。
2. 你指出任何其他玩家的一张牌，然后“猜”出它的数字，比如“黑5”，“白6”等等。对手
必须根据实际情况，答复你“对”或者“错”。
     - 如果你猜对，则对手把这张牌在原来的位置摊开，让大家都看到。只要你猜对，你可
     以重复步骤2。你也可以选择不猜，然后把刚才抓到的那张牌按前面的数字大小规则
     放回到你的牌队列中。每轮至少猜一次。
     - 如果你猜错，你要把你刚摸到的牌摊开，然后面朝上按前面的数字大小规则放回到你
的牌队列中。
3. 换下一个玩家。重复。

### 其他

---
- 每次猜的时间不要超过1 分钟。超过一分钟后，他人可以对其进行20 秒倒计时。如果还没有行动，则直接算猜错。    

- 使用Joker 的进阶玩法：
其余规则不变，但Joker 可以放在牌队列的任何地方！别人要猜它的话也必须直接说出“Joker”。
